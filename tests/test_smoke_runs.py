# The get_initial_params for MAPPO with shared_critic=True was trying to get agent.critic. Fixed.
# Corrected MATD3 actor update check logic based on total_iterations.
# The `total_iterations` logic for MATD3 actor update check in smoke test:
# `MATD3.total_iterations` is incremented *after* all agents `train`.
# `_MATD3Agent.train` receives the `total_iterations` value *before* this increment.
# So, if `MATD3.total_iterations` is `X` when `_MATD3Agent.train` is called,
# actor update happens if `X % policy_freq == 0`.
# After `MATD3.train` finishes, `MATD3.total_iterations` becomes `X+1`.
# So, to check if actor_loss should be present in `train_infos` for iteration `k` of the test loop (0-indexed):
# The value of `MATD3.total_iterations` *at the time of calling agent.train()* is `initial_matd3_total_it + k`.
# `initial_matd3_total_it` is 1. So, `(1 + k) % policy_freq == 0`.
# My test `(i + 1 + algo.total_iterations -1 ) % config.policy_freq == 0`
# `i` is loop var 0 to N-1. `algo.total_iterations` is the value *after* update.
# So `current_iter_for_agent_train = algo.total_iterations -1` is correct.
# Then `if current_iter_for_agent_train % config.policy_freq == 0:` is the condition.
# This seems correct.The smoke test file `tests/test_smoke_runs.py` has been created and populated with tests for MAPPO, MADDPG, MASAC, and MATD3.

**Key Implementation Details:**

1.  **Centralized Configuration Helper (`get_algo_config_spaces_env`):**
    *   A function was created to generate minimal configurations (`argparse.Namespace`), observation/action spaces (`gymnasium.spaces`), and a `MockMAEnv` instance tailored for each algorithm.
    *   It takes `action_type` ('Discrete' or 'Continuous') and `algo_name` to customize parameters appropriately (e.g., PPO params for MAPPO, TD3 params for MATD3, SAC params for MASAC).
    *   Default parameters are set for small networks, buffer/batch sizes, and few steps/updates to ensure tests run quickly.
    *   It ensures that `num_agents=1` is used for simplicity in these smoke tests.

2.  **Network Parameter Change Check (`get_initial_params`, `check_params_changed`):**
    *   Helper functions were implemented to retrieve all actor/critic parameters from an algorithm instance before training and then check if any of these parameters changed after a few training updates. This verifies that backpropagation and optimizer steps are occurring.

3.  **Smoke Test Structure (for each algorithm):**
    *   **Setup:**
        *   Obtain config, spaces, and mock environment using `get_algo_config_spaces_env`.
        *   Instantiate the algorithm (e.g., `MAPPO(args=config, ...)`).
        *   Instantiate the appropriate buffer (`RolloutStorage` for MAPPO, `ReplayBuffer` for off-policy algos) externally.
        *   Store initial network parameters.
    *   **Data Collection / Buffer Population:**
        *   **MAPPO (On-policy):** A loop runs for `config.n_steps` to collect one rollout. Inside the loop:
            *   `algo.act()` is called to get actions (handling tensor conversions and input shapes based on shared/non-shared policy assumptions from the main algorithm code).
            *   `env.step()` provides transitions.
            *   `algo.get_values()` is called to get value predictions for storage.
            *   Data is inserted into `RolloutStorage` with careful attention to expected shapes (e.g., `(n_rollout_threads, num_agents, ...)`).
        *   **Off-policy (MADDPG, MASAC, MATD3):** A loop runs for enough steps to populate the `ReplayBuffer` beyond `batch_size`.
            *   `algo.act()` is called (with exploration where appropriate).
            *   `env.step()` provides transitions.
            *   Data is added to `ReplayBuffer`.
            *   Environment is reset if all agents are done.
    *   **Training Step:**
        *   **MAPPO:** After the rollout, `storage.compute_returns_and_advantages()` is called, followed by `algo.train(storage)`.
        *   **Off-policy:** `algo.train(buffer)` is called.
    *   **Assertions:**
        *   The data collection and training loops complete without exceptions.
        *   The `train_info` dictionary (or relevant loss attributes on agents) contains expected loss keys (e.g., `actor_loss`, `critic_loss`).
        *   Loss values are floats and not NaN.
        *   `check_params_changed()` asserts that network parameters have been updated.
    *   **Algorithm-Specific Logic:**
        *   For MATD3, the training loop runs for `config.policy_freq * 2` iterations to ensure the delayed actor update is tested. Assertions for `actor_loss` are conditional on the iteration number.

4.  **Import Handling:** Uses `pytest.mark.skipif` to skip tests if algorithm or buffer classes cannot be imported, allowing tests to be selectively run based on available modules.

This set of smoke tests provides a basic end-to-end check for each algorithm, ensuring that the data flow, action selection, buffer interaction, and training steps execute without critical errors and result in network updates. Many detailed corrections were made during implementation to align data shapes and method calls with the specifics of each algorithm and buffer, as inferred from their respective detailed test suites.Okay, the smoke tests for all four algorithms (MAPPO, MADDPG, MASAC, MATD3) have been implemented in `tests/test_smoke_runs.py`.

**Summary of Implementation:**

1.  **File Creation and Imports:**
    *   `tests/test_smoke_runs.py` was created.
    *   Necessary modules including `pytest`, `torch`, `numpy`, `argparse`, `gymnasium.spaces`, all four algorithm classes, `ReplayBuffer`, `RolloutStorage`, and `MockMAEnv` were imported. Conditional imports with `pytest.skipif` are used for algorithms and buffers to allow tests to run if some modules are unavailable.

2.  **Helper Function (`get_algo_config_spaces_env`):**
    *   A comprehensive helper function was created to generate minimal configurations (`argparse.Namespace`), observation spaces, action spaces (supporting 'Discrete' and 'Continuous'), and a `MockMAEnv` instance.
    *   This function takes `algo_name` and other parameters to tailor the configuration for each specific algorithm (e.g., PPO parameters for MAPPO, TD3 parameters for MATD3, SAC parameters for MASAC, DDPG parameters for MADDPG).
    *   It defaults to `num_agents=1` and small network/buffer/batch sizes for quick execution.

3.  **Network Parameter Change Verification (`get_initial_params`, `check_params_changed`):**
    *   Two helper functions were implemented:
        *   `get_initial_params(algo_instance)`: Retrieves and clones all actor and critic parameters from an algorithm instance. It handles both list-of-agents structures and shared policy/critic structures (relevant for MAPPO).
        *   `check_params_changed(initial_params, algo_instance)`: Compares current parameters with a stored set of initial parameters to assert that network weights have indeed changed after training updates.

4.  **Individual Smoke Test Functions (e.g., `test_smoke_run_mappo`):**
    *   For each algorithm (MAPPO, MADDPG, MASAC, MATD3):
        *   **Configuration & Setup:** Uses `get_algo_config_spaces_env` to get a tailored config, spaces, and a `MockMAEnv`. Instantiates the algorithm and the appropriate buffer (`RolloutStorage` for MAPPO, `ReplayBuffer` for off-policy algorithms). Initial network parameters are stored.
        *   **Data Collection Loop:**
            *   **MAPPO (On-Policy):** Simulates one full rollout (`config.n_steps`). `algo.act()` is called to get actions, `env.step()` for transitions, and `algo.get_values()` for value predictions. Data is inserted into `RolloutStorage` with careful attention to the expected shapes (e.g., `(n_rollout_threads, num_agents, ...)`).
            *   **Off-Policy (MADDPG, MASAC, MATD3):** A loop runs for enough steps (`config.batch_size + safety_margin`) to ensure the `ReplayBuffer` can be sampled. `algo.act()` (with exploration considerations) gets actions, `env.step()` provides transitions, and data is added to the `ReplayBuffer`. Environment is reset if `all_done`.
        *   **Training Step Execution:**
            *   **MAPPO:** `storage.compute_returns_and_advantages()` is called, then `algo.train(storage)`.
            *   **Off-Policy:** `algo.train(buffer)` is called.
        *   **Assertions:**
            *   The primary assertion is that the data collection and training loops complete without raising Python exceptions.
            *   The `train_info` dictionary returned by the algorithm's `train` method (or relevant loss attributes on agents) is checked for the presence of expected loss keys (e.g., `actor_loss`, `critic_loss`).
            *   Loss values are asserted to be floats and not `NaN`.
            *   `check_params_changed()` is called to ensure network parameters were updated by the training process.
        *   **Algorithm-Specific Details:**
            *   For MATD3, the training loop runs for `config.policy_freq * 2` iterations to ensure the delayed actor update logic is exercised, with conditional checks for `actor_loss`.
            *   Input tensor shapes and types for `algo.act()` and buffer/storage `insert()` methods were carefully managed based on insights from previous detailed algorithm tests.

These smoke tests provide a crucial first line of defense, ensuring that each algorithm can initialize, interact with a mock environment and its designated buffer type, and execute a few training steps without crashing, while also verifying that learning (parameter updates and valid loss values) is happening at a basic level.

All planned tests for this subtask are complete.
